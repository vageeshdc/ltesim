1) An overview
--------------
LTE-Sim is an open source framework to simulate LTE networks.
It encompasses several aspects of LTE networks, including 
both the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRAN) 
and the Evolved Packet System (EPS). 
It supports single and multi-cell environments, QoS management, 
multi users environment, user mobility, handover procedures, 
and frequency reuse techniques. Three kinds of network nodes 
are modeled: user equipment (UE), evolved Node B (eNB) and 
Mobility Management Entity/Gateway (MME/GW). Four different traffic 
generators at the application layer have been implemented and the 
management of data radio bearer is supported. Finally, well-known 
scheduling strategies (such as Proportional Fair, Modified Largest 
Weighted Delay First, and Exponential Proportional Fair), AMC scheme, 
Channel Quality Indicator feedback, frequency reuse techniques, and 
models for physical layer have been developed.

2) Getting LTE-Sim
------------------
LTE-sim is available via Subversion at 
http://telematics.poliba.it/svn/LTE-Sim/

To obtain LTE-Sim enter into the your prefered folder and
write the following syntax:

	$ svn co http://telematics.poliba.it/svn/LTE-Sim/

To synchronize the project repository with the local copy, you 
can run update sub-command. The syntax is as follows:

	$ svn update


3) Compiling LTE-Sim
--------------------
On recent Linux systems, you can buil LTE-Sim with the
following command:

	$ make

To clear the project, you can use the following command:

	$ make clean


4) Running LTE-Sim
------------------
In this release several LTE scenarios have been developed.
To run a simple simulation, you can use the following command:

	$ ./LTE-Sim Simple 

For more details about available LTE scenario, use

	$ ./LTE-Sim -h

If you want to create a new LTE scenario, see tutorial and
manual (you can find them into the DOC/ folder) for details.


5) LTE-Sim  documentation
-------------------------
All of that documentation should always be available from
the LTE-Sim website: http:://telematics.poliba.it/LTE-Sim
but we include it in this release for ease of use.

You can find it in DOC folder. This documentation includes:
  - a tutorial
  - a manual (not yet available!)

Moreover, a dedicated mailing list has been createt at 
http://groups.google.com/group/lte-sim/
